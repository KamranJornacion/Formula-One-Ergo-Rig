# Formula One Ergo Rig Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete design, analysis, and documentation of an Ergo Rig project I developed as part of the Formula One team. The Ergo Rig is a custom-designed framework that enables the team to accurately measure and fit drivers, ensuring the optimal design of the vehicle’s chassis and seat.

## 🚀 Project Purpose
The primary objective of this project was to create an ergonomic rig that can accurately measure driver dimensions, allowing the team to design a chassis and custom-fit seating arrangement that provides both comfort and optimal driving posture for the driver.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- **CADParts/** - Contains all the CAD files for the individual components used in the assembly.
- **CostAnalysis.docx** - Provides a rough cost analysis of the Ergo Rig project, including material and manufacturing costs.
- **ErgoRig_Assembly.jpg** - A rendered image of the fully assembled Ergo Rig.

## 📝 Features
- Adjustable components to accommodate drivers of various sizes.
- Sturdy frame design ensuring accurate measurements.
- Modular CAD design for easy modifications.

## 📐 CAD Design Details
The Ergo Rig was designed using advanced CAD software, with all components carefully designed for ease of assembly and accuracy. Key measurements are included in the design to ensure precise driver fitting.

## 💡 How It Works
1. The driver is positioned on the Ergo Rig.
2. Adjustable components are moved to match the driver’s measurements.
3. The measured values are recorded, which are then used for chassis and seat design.

## 🚦 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Access the CADParts folder to view all CAD designs.
3. Review the cost analysis for project budget insights.
4. Explore the rendered assembly image for an overview of the final design.
